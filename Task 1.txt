-- 1. Display all students and their details:
  SELECT * FROM Students;
-- 2. Calculate the average scores for each subject:
  SELECT 
    AVG(MathScore) AS AvgMathScore,
    AVG(ScienceScore) AS AvgScienceScore,
    AVG(EnglishScore) AS AvgEnglishScore
  FROM Students;

-- 3. Find the student(s) with the highest total score:
  SELECT

    Name, 
    (MathScore + ScienceScore + EnglishScore) AS TotalScore 
  FROM Students 
  ORDER BY TotalScore DESC 
  LIMIT 1;

-- 4. Count the number of students in each grade:
  SELECT 
    Grade, 
    COUNT(*) AS StudentCount 
  FROM Students 
  GROUP BY Grade;
-- 5. Find the average score for male and female students:
  SELECT 
    Gender, 
    AVG((MathScore + ScienceScore + EnglishScore) / 3) AS AvgOverallScore 
  FROM Students 
  GROUP BY Gender;
-- 6. Identify students with Math scores above 80:
  SELECT 
    StudentID, 
    Name, 
    MathScore 
  FROM Students 
  WHERE MathScore > 80;

-- 7. Update the grade of a student with a specific Student ID:
  UPDATE Students 
  SET Grade = 'A' 
  WHERE StudentID = 4;
